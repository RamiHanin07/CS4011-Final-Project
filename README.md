Hi professor!

Just explaining how this should work based on the guidelines indicated on the "Final Project" canvas page.


1) The UI lists all of the blog posts from the database
    - Yes it does

2) There must be some way to create a new blog post
    - in the "Title" text box, type out a title
    - in the "Body" text box, type out the body of the post
    - click the "Post" button


3) Some way to edit an existing blog post
    - Press the Title of the post you wish to edit
    - Fill in either/both of the "Body" or "Title" text box with the new body or title.
    - Press the "Edit" button

4) Some way to delete a blog post
    - Press the Title of the post you wish to edit
    - Press the "Delete" button

5) At minimum, each post must have a title and text
    - Each post has a title, text

6) After creation, edit, or deletion, the UI must update automatically to show all of the current blog posts.
    - It does!


This was, a really fun project. I did a hackathon a month ago where we used MongoDB and react to build a Wordle clone for dogs, and spent so long trying to get a MongoDB database setup, get the API setup, and get it hooked up to the react front end. Doing this project using your videos and the things we learned in class helped speed up the absolute slog that was trying to set it all up on my own in the hackathon without knowing what to do. I appreciate it!
